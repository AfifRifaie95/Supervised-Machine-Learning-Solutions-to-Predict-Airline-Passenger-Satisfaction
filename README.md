The study employs KNN, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting,. A thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), data pre-processing steps, including one-hot, label encoding, and feature selection were performed to ensure model accuracy. The algorithm was then optimized using hyperparameter tuning, RandomizedSearchCV &amp; GridSearchCV.
