# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Solutions-to-Predict-Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
This report explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict airline
passenger satisfaction, identifying a crucial predictor for enhancing customer loyalty,
profitability and service quality. The study employs machine learning models, including K-
Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, applied to a dataset
containing passenger satisfaction metrics. A thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), data
pre-processing steps, including one-hot, label encoding, and feature selection were
performed to ensure model accuracy. The algorithm was then optimized using
hyperparameter tuning methods, such as RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. The
results demonstrate that the tuned Gradient Boosting has achieved the highest accuracy of
95%, with features like online boarding, in-flight Wi-Fi service, passenger eco class and
personal type of travel being significant predictors of satisfaction.
